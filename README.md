# DOM Data Mirror 
### (or d-data for short)

D-DATA IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED AND IN VERY EARLY STAGES.
THINGS MAY NOT WORK AS DESCRIBED IN THE DOCS... PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE
EXAMPLES AND THE SOURCE FOR AN IDEA OF WHERE THE CODE CURRENTLY IS.

THE Examples/test.html IS FREQUENTLY UPDATED AND A GOOD PLACE TO
SEE IF THE BASIC TESTS ARE PASSING.
