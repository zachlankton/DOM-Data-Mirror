        		<h3>Web Apps as simple as writing HTML</h3>
        		
        		<p>
        			DOM Data Mirror (dData for short) is an experiment created to demonstrate the 
        			possibility of writing simple applications with just HTML. 
        		</p>
        		
                <p>
        		dData, by itself, doesn't necessarily accomplish this.  However, dData
        		is extensible and included in the code base are some extensions that bring this goal
        		closer to reality.
                </p>

                <p>
        		By writing some simple extensions you can considerably reduce the 
        		amount of boilerplate and javascript required in your app.  We will show how this can be done in the
        		examples to follow.
