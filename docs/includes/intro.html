        		<h3>Web Apps as simple as writing HTML</h3>
        		
        		<p>
        			DOM Data Mirror (dData for short) is an experiment created in an attempt to accomplish a few tasks... 
        		</p>
        		<ul>
                    <li>Decrease Code Required to create Basic Web Apps</li>
                    <li>Extend HTML, instead of abstracting over it</li>
                    <li>Reduce or eliminate controller code</li>
                    <li>Reduce or eliminate the need for frameworks</li>
        		</ul>

                <p>
        		dData, by itself, doesn't necessarily accomplish all of these things.  However, dData
        		is extendable and included in the code base are some extensions that start pushing dData in that direction. 
                </p>

                <p>
        		By writing some simple extensions you can considerably reduce the 
        		amount of boilerplate required in your app.  We will show how this can be done in the
        		examples to follow.
