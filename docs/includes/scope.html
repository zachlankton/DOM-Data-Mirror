<h1>Scope</h1>
                <p>If you are familiar with Angular, Vue, React, and other JS frameworks, then you are probably familiar
                with the concept of scope.  Scope helps keep code modular and separated from other code.  
                Global Variables have a higher chance of overwriting something that already exists, or being overwritten
                in the future by some other code that comes along.</p>

                <p>When building simple applications, if less than a few people are contributing and 
                can keep track of the names of their dData objects and everyone elses, using the default <code>dData[objectName]</code>
                scope should work just fine.
                </p>

                <p>When building larger, more complex, applications with more contributors, making use of 
                different scopes becomes imperative to keeping code organized and helping to prevent really
                strange bugs that are very difficult to track down.  You and you're team will need to 
                decide the best approach for your application.</p>

                <p> To use your own custom scope with dData, you can use the <code>scope</code> attribute on the root
                dData Element.  <strong><em>This will not work on d-data child elements. </em></strong> d-data child elements
                inherit their scope directly from their parent d-data element. </p>

                <a name="ScopeExample2"></a>
                <h2>Example 2</h2>
                <p>As shown in the previous example, if the scope does not exist, dData will create it automatically
                This next example shows that you can create a scope object elsewhere and fill it with initial
                data and dData will use that object.  However, for this to work, the scope object needs to 
                be created before the browser
                renders the d-data element. </p>
