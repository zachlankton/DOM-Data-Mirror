<h1>Extensions</h1>

                <p>dData is was written with extensibilty in mind.  d-Data Extensions are basically functions that
                extend any d-data children elements with a given attribute. You can create extensions for any attribute,
                even native ones.  You're extension function will run for every element that has the attribute you want
                to extend.
                </p>

                <p>
                Currently there are only a couple of dData events you can use to trigger event based functionality
                But more will be added with each use case that presents itself.</p>

                <p>Now that you have a rough idea of how extensions are made, please look at the source
                of some of the available plugins to get a better idea of some good patterns for developing
                plugins.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/zachlankton/DOM-Data-Mirror/blob/master/Extensions/dData.AddRemove.ext.js" target="new">Add &amp; Remove Extension</a></h2>
                <p>The Add and Remove extensions is the simplest extension there is for dData.
                It provides 2 attributes "add" and "remove" (I know, right?).</p>

                <p>Whatever element these attributes are attached to get wired up
                with a click handler that gives you a shortcut to add and remove
                dData Child Elements.<p>

                <p>The "add" attribute accepts a value that is a string.  This string
                should be the name of a child element that you want to have added.  This
                attribute should be use OUTSIDE of the d-data element you want to add.</p>

                <p>The "remove" attribute does not need any arguments.  Simply place it 
                INSIDE the d-data element you want removed, and it will handle the rest.</p>

                <p>To illustrate this, let's improve our Simple Todo list example from earlier.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/zachlankton/DOM-Data-Mirror/blob/master/Extensions/dData.Filter.ext.js" target="new">Filter Extension</a></h2>
                <p>The Filter extension is exactly that.... an extension that can be used to filter stuff. :-)</p>
                <p>The "filter" attribute takes a value formated like this <code>filter="childName:fieldName"</code></p>
                <p>childName is required and can be any d-data child element.  The fieldName is optional
                and if it is set it will only look at fields by that name.  If not, it looks at every value
                from every field.... even deeply nested ones.</p>
                <p>Here is our filter example... with nested items.</p>
